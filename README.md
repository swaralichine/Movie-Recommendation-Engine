# Recommendation Engine


The entertainment industry today is massively driven by Movies.Ever since the emergence of on-demand platforms like Netflix, Prime-Video, etc. the need to leverage data and technology to streamline the process of content consumption has increased manifold.

With the advent of Machine Learning, these platforms can accurately recommend movies to watch based on our watching habits.
These models use clustering techniques to identify data points to make accurate predictions.
In this project, we aim to compare such models using Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization and Item-based KNN, and test it on the 20M MovieLens dataset to predict users' movies to watch.
